""" Web server for SCRABBLE(tm) rack permutations

    Author: Vilhjalmur Thorsteinsson, 2014

    This web server module uses the Flask framework to implement
    a simple form page where the user can enter a SCRABBLE(tm) rack
    and get a list of all legal word permutations from the rack,
    as well as combinations with a single additional letter.

    The actual permutation engine is found in skraflpermuter.py

    The server is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.x, CPython and PyPy.
    (To get it to run under PyPy 2.7.6 the author had to patch
    \pypy\lib-python\2.7\mimetypes.py to fix a bug that was not
    present in the CPython 2.7 distribution of the same file.)
